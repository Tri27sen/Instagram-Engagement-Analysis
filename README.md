Instagram Engagement Analysis
This project analyzes Instagram engagement data to uncover insights about user interactions with posts. The dataset consists of various metrics related to Instagram posts, including impressions from different sources, engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, saves), and additional contextual information (captions and hashtags).

Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following columns:

A bar graph illustrating the hashtags used in the posts and their respective lengths.
Distribution of Impressions:

From Home: A histogram showing the distribution of impressions coming from the home feed.
From Hashtags: A histogram showing the distribution of impressions coming from hashtags.
From Explore: A histogram showing the distribution of impressions coming from the explore section.
Impressions on Instagram Posts From Various Sources:

A pie chart visualizing the proportion of impressions coming from different sources (Home, Hashtags, Explore, Other).
Major Hashtags Used:

Identification of the most frequently used hashtags in the posts.
Relationship Analysis:

Likes and Impressions: Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the number of likes and total impressions.
Comments and Impressions: Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the number of comments and total impressions.
Shares and Impressions: Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the number of shares and total impressions.
Saves and Impressions: Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between the number of saves and total impressions.
Heatmap of All Parameters:

A heatmap representing the correlations between all numerical parameters in the dataset.
Profile Visits and Followers Gained:

Analysis of the relationship between profile visits and the number of followers gained.
Predictive Model
In addition to the above analyses, a predictive model has been created to help users predict the growth of their Instagram profiles based on historical engagement data. This model leverages the various engagement metrics to provide insights into potential future performance.

Model Evaluation
The performance of several regression models was evaluated to determine the best model for predicting Instagram engagement metrics:

Linear Regression: MSE: 4746059.12, Model Score: 0.878
Ridge Regression: MSE: 4745076.01, Model Score: 0.878
Lasso Regression: MSE: 4745025.67, Model Score: 0.878
Random Forest Regressor: MSE: 4676533.44, Model Score: 0.880
Gradient Boosting Regressor: MSE: 1177156.73, Model Score: 0.970
XGBoost: MSE: 1014109.91, Model Score: 0.974
Support Vector Regressor: MSE: 45587713.52, Model Score: -0.174
MLP Regressor: MSE: 3442022.02, Model Score: 0.911
Bayesian Ridge Regression: MSE: 4039600.12, Model Score: 0.896
Conclusion: XGBoost and Gradient Boosting Regressor are the best models for this dataset, with XGBoost slightly outperforming Gradient Boosting Regressor. These models should be considered for further fine-tuning and potential use in predicting Instagram engagement metrics.
